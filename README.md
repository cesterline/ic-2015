# ic-2015
ic rework 2015

Built with Bootstrap 3.3.4 and FezVrasta's Material Design theme (https://github.com/FezVrasta/bootstrap-material-design).


NOTES:

1) While in dev it was uncovered that FezVrasta's Material Design theme, where forms are concerned, 
fallsback (to native Bootstrap look and feel) gracefully for IE9 or less.  Though unexpected the outcome proved valuable.
In order to take advantage of this 'feature' ensure you ref 'material-fullpalette.min.css' in place of 'material.min.css'.

2) Responsive functionality is currently locked down for initial release.

3) Work to define large desktop, tablet and mobile have yet to have been performed.  Date TBD.
